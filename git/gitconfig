# Default behavior for git push
#    nothing - do not push anything.
#    matching - push all branches having the same name in both ends.
#    upstream - push the current branch to its upstream branch.
#    simple - like upstream, but refuses to push if the upstream branchâ€™s name is different from the local one.
#    current - push the current branch to a branch of the same name.
